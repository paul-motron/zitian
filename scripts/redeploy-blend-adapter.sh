# Deploy a fresh BlendAdapter and point an already-live coordinator vault at
# it via set_adapter. Use this to push new adapter code (e.g. accrue(),
# get_pool(), get_protocol()) to a live vault without redeploying the vault
# itself, since adapter contracts have no in-place upgrade path (no
# update_current_contract_wasm function) — the only way to update an
# adapter's code is to deploy a new contract and swap the vault onto it.
#
# IMPORTANT: set_adapter resets the vault's adapter-share accounting
# (ADPT_SH) to zero and does not itself move any funds out of the old
# adapter first. If the vault has real depositors, use migrate_adapter
# instead of set_adapter for the final step this script prints, it moves
# the vault's entire position to the new adapter atomically, with a
# slippage-bounded value check, and does not require every depositor to
# withdraw first. set_adapter remains correct only for a vault with no
# depositors yet (e.g. right after a fresh deploy, before any real funds
# are at risk).

# Usage: VAULT_ID=<live vault> DEPLOYER=<key> bash scripts/redeploy-blend-adapter.sh
