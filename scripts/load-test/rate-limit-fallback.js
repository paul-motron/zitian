// Characterizes the in-memory rate-limit fallback's per-instance behavior
// under concurrent load (issue #719's primary motivation).
//
// api/_lib/middleware.ts enforces LIMIT=100 requests / 60s PER CLIENT IP.
// When UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL / UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN are NOT configured
// on the deployment, it falls back to a plain in-memory Map — one per
// serverless function instance. Vercel can (and under concurrent load,
// will) spin up multiple warm instances behind the same URL, and each one
// keeps its own independent counter: nothing shares state between them. So
// the *effective* limit for a single client IP becomes roughly
// (LIMIT * number of warm instances hit), not LIMIT — exactly the
// "per-instance behavior under load" the issue calls out.
//
// This script sends sustained traffic against a read endpoint (chosen so a
// large volume of requests is safe and cheap) from a single k6 process,
// which the target sees as one client IP (or a small handful, if you're
// behind a NAT/proxy). It counts allowed vs. 429 responses so you can
// compare the observed allow-rate against the configured LIMIT=100/min.
//
// HOW TO USE THIS:
//   1. Run once against a preview deployment WITHOUT Upstash configured.
//      Expect the observed allow-rate to run well above ~100-110/min if
//      more than one instance gets warmed — that's the bug this issue
//      exists to characterize, not a failure of this script.
//   2. Run again against the same deployment WITH Upstash configured (or
//      against a deployment where it's `strict: true`-gated) to confirm the
//      distributed limiter holds the line at ~100/min regardless of how
//      many instances are behind it.
//   3. Local dev (`pnpm --filter @zitian/api-local dev`) is a single
//      process, so it CANNOT reproduce the per-instance issue — a passing
//      result there proves nothing about the deployed behavior. Always run
//      this against a real Vercel deployment.
//
// Usage:
//   k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://your-preview.vercel.app scripts/load-test/rate-limit-fallback.js
//
// Tunables (all optional): RPS, DURATION, VUS, MAX_VUS, ACCOUNTS_FILE
