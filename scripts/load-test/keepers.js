// Load/race test for GET /api/v1/keepers/:action
// (api/v1/keepers/[action].ts). Covers `health` (public, read-only) and
// probes the submission-lease race on `accrue`/`rebalance`/`alert`
// (packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/keeper-state.ts, SubmissionLease).
//
// DANGER: accrue and rebalance sign and submit REAL Stellar transactions off
// the keeper's own funded key (ZITIAN_KEEPER_SECRET_KEY /
// ZITIAN_MIGRATION_KEEPER_SECRET_KEY). Only ever point this at a
// throwaway testnet deployment configured with its own throwaway keeper
// keys and its own throwaway CRON_SECRET.
//   * NEVER run this against a production/mainnet deployment.
//   * NEVER use a real project's CRON_SECRET here.
//
// This script's `concurrentInvocation` scenario is not a throughput test —
// it's a race probe. keeper-state.ts's SubmissionLease uses `SET NX` so that
// when two invocations of the same action land close together (a scheduled
// run overlapping a manual trigger, or — as here — several k6 iterations
// firing at once), only one should actually attempt the on-chain call; the
// rest should see the target already claimed and return quickly without
// broadcasting a second transaction. Concurrency is deliberately small
// (default 5) and the run is a single shared-iterations burst, not a
// sustained load, because the thing being tested is mutual exclusion, not
// capacity.
//
// Usage:
//   k6 run \
//     -e BASE_URL=https://your-preview.vercel.app \
//     -e CRON_SECRET=your-throwaway-secret \
//     scripts/load-test/keepers.js
//
// Tunables (all optional): HEALTH_RPS, DURATION, CONCURRENCY, KEEPER_ACTION
// (accrue | rebalance | alert, default accrue)
//
// health's default HEALTH_RPS is intentionally conservative (1 req/s =
// 60/min) to stay under the API's 100 req/60s per-client-IP limit
// (api/_lib/middleware.ts, LIMIT), so the "health: 200" check below passes
// out of the box. Pass -e HEALTH_RPS=... to push past that budget on
// purpose.
