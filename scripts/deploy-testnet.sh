# Deploy a full, freshly-wired Zitian coordinator vault stack to Stellar
# testnet: vault, a BlendAdapter, and the mUSDC share token, initialized and
# linked together. Use this to stand up a brand new environment. To push new
# adapter code to an ALREADY-LIVE vault without redeploying the vault itself,
# use scripts/redeploy-blend-adapter.sh instead.

# DEPLOYER must be set in the environment and funded via friendbot. It only
# pays fees and signs setup transactions; it does not need to be kept around
# afterward. Vault admin control is a separate identity (see ADMIN below).

# ADMIN is the address that becomes the deployed vault's permanent admin
# (transfer_admin, set_paused, set_adapter). Deliberately independent of DEPLOYER
# so the deploying key can be thrown away after the run. Defaults to
# DEPLOYER's own address for local/dev convenience, but should always be
# explicitly set to a durable key (or multisig) for anything beyond a
# throwaway testnet run, and MUST be set explicitly ahead of any mainnet
# deployment. Public key only (G...), not a secret key.

# ADMIN_KEY is the signing key (a Stellar secret key, or a `stellar keys`
# alias) for the ADMIN address above. Required whenever ADMIN is a separate
# address from DEPLOYER. The vault's constructor calls admin.require_auth(),
# and Soroban only honors require_auth() inside a constructor for the address
# that is the deploying transaction's own source account — so ADMIN itself,
# not DEPLOYER, must source and pay for the vault's deploy transaction. This
# is what proves ADMIN's key genuinely exists and its holder consents, unlike
# just being told an address by whoever runs this script. It must therefore
# also be funded (see "Standing up a fresh environment" below).
#
# If ADMIN_KEY is genuinely not available where the script runs, it falls
# back to printing the vault's deploy command for the ADMIN key holder to run
# themselves. Unlike the old two-step deploy-then-initialize() flow, there is
# no "deployed but claimable" window in that case: blend-adapter and mUSDC
# get deployed and permanently wired to the vault's precomputed address, but
# the vault itself simply does not exist on-chain at all until that command
# is run, by ADMIN specifically.
