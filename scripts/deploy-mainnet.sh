# Deploy a full, freshly-wired Zitian coordinator vault stack to Stellar
# mainnet: vault, a BlendAdapter, and the mUSDC share token, initialized and
# linked together.
#
# Forked from scripts/deploy-testnet.sh (#717) with every testnet-only
# convenience removed rather than gated behind a flag, so there is no way to
# accidentally run this in a mode that behaves like the testnet script:
#   - ADMIN and ADMIN_KEY are hard-required. Neither ever defaults to
#     DEPLOYER, and there is no fallback path that lets this script finish
#     with the vault still undeployed for someone else to complete by hand.
#   - USDC_ID and BLEND_POOL_ID must resolve to an entry in the allow-lists
#     below, not any address an env var happens to name.
#   - An explicit typed confirmation is required before the first network
#     transaction, after every resolved value is printed for review.
#
# See apps/docs/operations/mainnet-deployment.md for the full runbook this
# script is one piece of: key custody, parameter selection, and the go-live
# checklist all live there, not here.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
#
# If a run fails partway through (e.g. a network timeout after blend-adapter
# or mUSDC already deployed), rerun with VAULT_SALT set to the value printed
# earlier as "VAULT_SALT (save this...)" so the retry reserves the same
# vault address instead of stranding those already-deployed contracts.

# The allow-lists below use associative arrays (bash 4+). macOS ships bash
# 3.2 by default (Apple stopped bundling GPLv3 bash), where `declare -A`
# fails with a bare syntax error before any of this script's actual
# validation runs. Fail with a clear message instead.
