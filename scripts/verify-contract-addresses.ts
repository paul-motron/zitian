/**
 * Verifies the vault contract addresses this repo records against the deploy
 * record in packages/shared/deployed-contracts.json, and, when a redeployment
 * is being recorded, against the bytecode actually live on-chain.
 *
 * This guards a specific supply-chain risk: a PR can submit clean, reviewable
 * source while pointing a contract address at different, unreviewed bytecode
 * the contributor deployed themselves. Reviewing the source diff alone cannot
 * catch that.
 *
 * Zitian's vault is immutable (no update_current_contract_wasm), so the
 * bytecode at a recorded address never changes once deployed. That lets the
 * check separate two cases instead of rebuilding on every PR:
 *
 *   1. The deploy record was NOT edited in this PR.
 *      - Addresses in the record and CONTRACT_ADDRESSES agree: pass without a
 *        build. The addresses are unchanged, so their bytecode is unchanged.
 *      - Addresses disagree: fail. An address moved without updating the
 *        deploy record, which a genuine redeployment always does.
 *   2. The deploy record WAS edited in this PR.
 *      - Record and CONTRACT_ADDRESSES disagree: fail. The two files must
 *        state the same addresses.
 *      - They agree: build the vault from this PR's source and compare the
 *        hash against the on-chain bytecode at every address that changed in
 *        this PR. A match passes; a mismatch fails.
 *
 * A manual run (workflow_dispatch, no base commit to diff against) audits
 * every recorded address by building and comparing against the chain.
 *
 * Only the vault contract is checked, since it's the only contract whose
 * address is tracked here and whose source lives in this repo. Third-party
 * contracts (Blend's pool, DeFindex's factory/vault, the USDC/EURC issuers)
 * can't be verified this way, since nobody here controls their source.
