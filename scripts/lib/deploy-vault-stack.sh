# Shared vault + BlendAdapter + mUSDC deployment orchestration for
# scripts/deploy-testnet.sh and scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh (#717).
#
# Extracted because the constructor-argument wiring below has changed three
# times already for front-running fixes (#505, #550, #551): keeping two
# independent copies of it risked the mainnet script silently deploying with
# stale wiring, or failing mid-sequence with blend-adapter/mUSDC already
# permanently wired to the wrong vault address, the next time either
# contract's constructor changes and only one copy gets updated.
#
# Sourced, not executed directly. The caller must set these before sourcing:
#
#   STELLAR_NETWORK_FLAGS  Array of stellar-cli network flags, e.g.
#                          (--network testnet) or
#                          (--rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --network-passphrase "$NETWORK_PASSPHRASE").
#   DEPLOYER               Stellar secret key/alias that funds and signs the
#                          blend-adapter/mUSDC deploys.
#   ADMIN_ADDRESS          Vault admin public key (G...).
#   ADMIN_KEY              Signing key for ADMIN_ADDRESS, or "" if
#                          unavailable. When empty, deploy_vault_stack still
#                          deploys blend-adapter/mUSDC (wired to the vault's
#                          precomputed address) but leaves the vault itself
#                          undeployed and prints the command for ADMIN's
#                          holder to run themselves, matching
#                          deploy-testnet.sh's original fallback behavior.
#                          deploy-mainnet.sh hard-requires ADMIN_KEY to be
#                          set before it ever sources this file, so that
#                          fallback is dead code there, not a mainnet-unsafe
#                          convenience reintroduced through the back door.
#   TREASURY_ADDRESS       Dedicated address that receives performance-fee
#                          mUSDC. Constructor-fixed for this deployment.
#   USDC_ID                USDC contract address to wire the adapter to.
#   BLEND_POOL_ID          Blend pool contract address to wire the adapter to.
#   VAULT_SALT             Optional. Reuse the salt printed by a previous
#                          failed run to resume at the same reserved vault
#                          address instead of stranding its already-deployed
#                          blend-adapter/mUSDC. Leave unset for a fresh
#                          deploy: a random salt is generated and printed.
#   SKIP_BUILD             Optional. Set (to any value) to skip `stellar
#                          contract build` and use the WASM already present
#                          in packages/contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release
#                          as-is. For deploying a build already verified
#                          elsewhere (e.g. downloaded from a genuine Linux CI
#                          build) without this script's own build silently
#                          overwriting it with a locally-built one first.
#
# After sourcing, call deploy_vault_stack. It sets VAULT_ID, BLEND_ADAPTER_ID,
# MUSDC_ID, and VAULT_INITIALIZED (1 if the vault itself was deployed this
# run, 0 if the ADMIN_KEY-empty fallback above was taken) as globals.

  # for a front-run to land in. But blend-adapter and mUSDC's own
  # constructors need the vault's address, and the vault won't exist to
  # hand out an address until it is deployed. Soroban contract IDs are
  # deterministic from (network, source account, salt) alone, independent
  # of the wasm being deployed, so a random salt lets the vault's address
  # be computed up front, handed to blend-adapter/mUSDC, and then the vault
  # is deployed to that exact same address with a matching --salt. The

  # after this point (e.g. blend-adapter or mUSDC deploys below) used to
  # strand those contracts permanently: the vault address they were wired to

  # gone. VAULT_SALT lets a retry after a partial failure reuse the exact

  # and mUSDC deploys already on-chain from the failed run stay usable
  # instead of being orphaned. Always echoed below so it can be recovered
