/**
 * The engine runs simulations. It may read market data over RPC, and it may not
 * sign or submit, so an unlaunched strategy cannot reach real funds.
 *
 * The flag that would lift that boundary is a build-time property rather than a
 * runtime switch. It is read from `ZITIAN_STRATEGIES_LIVE_EXECUTION`, and any
 * value other than the exact string "true" leaves the engine in simulation
 * mode, so a missing, empty or misspelled value fails closed. There is no
 * setter: the single place a launch flips this is that variable in the
 * deployment that runs strategies.
