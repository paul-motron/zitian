// Admin-event alerting keeper (#707).
//
// #698 added on-chain events for admin actions (paused, transfer, adapter,
// migrate, accept) and getRpcAdminHistory (admin-history.ts, #697) already
// knows how to read them back from Soroban RPC. Nothing consumed that feed
// for alerting until now: an unexpected pause or an adapter migration was
// only noticed by whoever happened to check the app.
//
// This keeper polls getRpcAdminHistory per known Zitian vault, starting
// from a persisted "last-processed ledger" cursor so a restart never
// replays events it already alerted on, and posts one webhook message per
// qualifying action. It deliberately reuses keeper-heartbeat.ts's
// KeeperHeartbeatStore for that cursor: the store is already a generic
// last-write-wins numeric KV (see its own header comment), and a ledger
// cursor has exactly the same consistency requirements as a heartbeat
// timestamp — the last run to finish is definitionally the most recent
// state, so no lease/CAS semantics are needed here either.
//
// `accept_admin` is intentionally excluded from alerting even though it is
// a recognised RpcAdminActionType: it is the second half of an
// already-alerted `transfer_admin` nomination, not a new risk on its own
// (see #707's acceptance criteria, which lists paused/transfer/adapter/
// migrate only).
