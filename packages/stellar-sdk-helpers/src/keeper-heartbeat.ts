// Last-successful-run tracking for scheduled keepers (#615).
//
// keeper-state.ts's SubmissionLease deliberately *clears* its record the
// moment a transaction's fate is known (see clearRecord there) — it exists
// to dedup in-flight submissions, not to remember history, so "last
// success" is nowhere on disk once a run finishes cleanly. The admin
// dashboard's Keeper Health card needs exactly that history, so this module
// is a second, much simpler store: an unconditional last-write-wins
// timestamp per keeper, with no lease/CAS semantics at all. A heartbeat is a
// monitoring signal, not a correctness guard, so the races SubmissionLease
// guards against (two runs racing to claim the same target) don't apply
// here — the last run to finish is, definitionally, the most recent
// success, whichever one that was.
//
// Reuses the same UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN pair as keeper-state.ts and
// api/_lib/middleware.ts rather than adding a new store dependency.
