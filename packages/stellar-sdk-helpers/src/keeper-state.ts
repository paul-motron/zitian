// Cross-invocation submission tracking for scheduled keepers (#515).
//
// keeper-tx.ts's `priorHash` only lives inside a single invocation: if the
// process is killed (or a run exhausts its retries) while a transaction is
// sent but unconfirmed, the next cron tick has no memory of it. For
// `accrue()` that costs a wasted fee; for `migrate_adapter` it costs real
// slippage twice, since each call is its own slippage-bounded transaction.
//
// The unit of state is a lease on one keeper target, taken in two steps:
//
//  1. `SET NX` a hash-less claim *before* the transaction is built. This is
//     what makes "no record" mean "nobody is working on this target": a
//     plain read beforehand would let two genuinely concurrent invocations
//     (a scheduled run overlapping a manual `workflow_dispatch`) both see
//     nothing and both broadcast. Claims are short-lived, so a crash during
//     build costs a bounded delay, not a stuck target.
//  2. Compare-and-set the real transaction hash into that claim as soon as
//     the transaction is *signed*, before `sendTransaction` is called. The
//     hash is derivable from the signed transaction, so a transaction that
//     reaches the mempool and then times out, or comes back
//     TRY_AGAIN_LATER, is always covered by a record. The cost is that a
//     crash between signing and broadcasting leaves a record for a
//     transaction that never went out; that record ages out at the
//     transaction's own validity window, which is exactly when it becomes
//     provably unable to land.
//
// Every write after the claim is conditional on the exact record this run
// put there (`revision`), so a slow run can never clobber or clear a newer
// run's record and hand a third run a clean slate to rebroadcast into.
//
// A record is never trusted on its word: every run resolves it by looking
// the hash up on-network, so "still unconfirmed" is an observed answer, not
// an assumption. See apps/docs/operations/migration-keeper.md for the state
// machine.
