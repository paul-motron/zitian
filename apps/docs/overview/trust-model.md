# Trust model

Zitian's vault holds real user USDC. This page states, in one place, what
the `ADMIN` key can and cannot do, what happens if it's lost or compromised,
and what that means for a depositor or an auditor evaluating custody risk.
The goal is to save the reader from reconstructing it from `docs/contracts.md`,
`SECURITY.md`, and scattered issue threads ([#557](https://github.com/drydocs/meridian/issues/557) in
particular). Nothing here is new policy: it's a consolidation of decisions
already made and already implemented, with citations back to the source.

**Current status, stated plainly:** Zitian is not deployed yet, and **no
independent security audit has been commissioned.** This page describes what
the contract's code enforces regardless of who holds `ADMIN` or how well; any
deployment should settle `ADMIN` key custody (hardware-backed or multisig, see
[Mainnet Deployment](../operations/mainnet-deployment.md#prerequisites-specific-to-mainnet))
before relying on this page for a custody decision.

## What the admin key can do

A single `Address` stored as `ADMIN` gates every one of these. There is no
per-action co-signer or committee check inside the contract itself. Whatever
`ADMIN` resolves to (a plain key, a hardware-backed key, a Stellar-native
multisig account) _is_ the entire on-chain access-control model for all five:

- **`set_paused(bool)`**: an emergency switch that rejects new deposits
  while set. **Withdrawals are deliberately left callable regardless of
  pause state**, by design. See the doc comment on `set_paused` in
  `packages/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs`, which states plainly that
  "a pause can never trap funds." An admin, malicious or not, cannot use
  pause to lock depositors out of their own funds.
- **`set_adapter(new_adapter)`**: repoints the vault at a different yield
  adapter, but only when the vault holds no position at all
  (`TOTAL_SH == 0` and `ADPT_SH == 0`). This is a bootstrap/recovery tool
  for an empty vault, not a live-migration path. See `migrate_adapter`
  below for the mechanism that exists for a vault with real depositors.
- **`begin_migration(new_adapter)` / `migrate_adapter(new_adapter, max_slippage_bps)`**:
  the two-phase, live-migration path. `begin_migration` snapshots the
  target adapter's reported value, then `migrate_adapter` can only execute
  once `MIN_LEDGER_GAP` (17,280 ledgers, ~1 day) has elapsed since that
  snapshot, and only within `MAX_ADMIN_SLIPPAGE_BPS` (500 bps, 5%) of
  value loss versus the snapshot. Both limits are compiled-in constants in
  `packages/contracts/vault/src/storage.rs`,
  not admin-adjustable at call time. See the "Parameter selection" table
  in [Mainnet Deployment](../operations/mainnet-deployment.md#parameter-selection)
  for their exact values, and [#557](https://github.com/drydocs/meridian/issues/557), the incident that established both
  limits (previously: unbounded slippage, ~1-minute timelock).
- **`transfer_admin(new_admin)` / `accept_admin()`**: a two-step handoff,
  in which the current admin nominates a successor, but authority only actually
  moves once the nominee calls `accept_admin` with their own signature.
  See "Key-loss and key-compromise consequences" below for what this
  design does and does not protect against.

That's the complete list. `deposit`, `withdraw`, `accrue` (the yield-accrual
keeper call), and every read-only getter require no special authority beyond
the caller's own signature where a signature is required at all.

## Performance-fee treasury

Each vault deployment fixes a dedicated `TREASURY` address in its constructor.
On a profitable withdrawal the vault charges 10% of the positive gain above
the withdrawing account's `Principal`, keeps that fee invested through the
active adapter, and mints the corresponding backed mUSDC shares to the
treasury. Principal, losses, and deposits are not charged.

Neither `ADMIN` nor the treasury can change the 10% rate or replace the
treasury address: the rate is compiled into the vault WASM, the address has no
setter, and the contract has no upgrade entry point. Changing either requires
a fresh vault deployment and coordinated cutover. The treasury controls the
fee shares it receives and can transfer or redeem them like any other mUSDC
holder. Promotional waivers are therefore operational rebates paid by the
treasury after the normal on-chain charge, not an admin-controlled bypass in
the vault.

## What the admin key structurally cannot do

- **There is no upgrade entry point, for the admin or anyone else.** See
  "Contract immutability" in `docs/contracts.md`:
  no `update_current_contract_wasm` or equivalent exists anywhere in the
  vault or either adapter. An admin-gated `upgrade()` was deliberately
  rejected specifically because it would compound the exact admin-authority
  risk this page documents, for a problem `migrate_adapter`/full-cutover
  redeployment already solves. Nothing on this page changes if the admin
  key is compromised, because there is no code-level lever labeled
  "upgrade" for a compromised key to pull.
- **Admin actions cannot touch individual depositor balances directly.**
  `set_adapter`/`migrate_adapter` move the vault's _aggregate_ adapter
  position; per-depositor accounting (`Principal`, `Entry`, mUSDC balances)
  is denominated in vault shares and is untouched by either call. See
  "Vault (`zitian-vault`)" in `docs/contracts.md`.
  There is no admin call that debits one depositor's shares or mints
  uncollateralized ones.
- **`migrate_adapter` cannot move funds with unlimited loss, and cannot
  move them instantly.** `MAX_ADMIN_SLIPPAGE_BPS` bounds the loss a single
  call can authorize regardless of the `max_slippage_bps` argument passed;
  `MIN_LEDGER_GAP` bounds how soon after `begin_migration` it can execute
  at all. Both are compiled into the deployed WASM, not runtime-configurable
  by `ADMIN` or anyone else without a full redeploy.
- **Pause cannot trap funds.** Covered above, worth restating here: pause
  is a deposit-only brake, not a custody mechanism.

## Key-loss and key-compromise consequences

**There is no on-chain recovery from a lost or destroyed `ADMIN` key.**
`transfer_admin` requires the _current_ admin's `require_auth()` (see the
function's doc comment in
`packages/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs`).
If that key is gone before a successor is nominated and has accepted, no
contract-level path replaces it. This is the same trade-off
`docs/contracts.md` makes
for code immutability, applied to the admin role specifically: any recovery
mechanism that didn't require the current admin's own signature would itself
be a takeover path for anyone else who found it. `deposit`/`withdraw` are not
admin-gated at all, so depositor funds remain accessible even if `ADMIN`
becomes permanently unreachable. What's lost is the ability to pause, swap
adapters, or migrate going forward, not depositor access to their own funds.

**A compromised `ADMIN` key cannot drain the vault in a single
transaction**, per the bounds in "What the admin key can do" above: a
`migrate_adapter` call is capped at 5% loss versus the pre-migration
snapshot and cannot execute until a day after the matching `begin_migration`
call. The vault's own doc comments name this explicitly. `begin_migration`'s
doc comment states plainly that the delay itself is
`the only thing standing between a leaked key and the vault's entire
position moving to an address the attacker controls`; `migrate_adapter`'s
own doc comment makes the same point independently, in its own words, citing the
same `MIN_LEDGER_GAP` mechanism as `what actually stands between a
compromised key and total loss`. Both are in
`packages/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs`. The timelock is a
detection-and-reaction _window_, not a mechanism that prevents the outcome
outright. It only has value if something is actually watching (the
[alert keeper](../operations/alert-keeper.md)) and someone is positioned to
react. `migrate_adapter`'s doc comment names the same two options this page
does: rotating the admin key via `transfer_admin`/`accept_admin`, or pausing
deposits, before the cooldown elapses. See the
"Rollback plan" section of
[Mainnet Deployment](../operations/mainnet-deployment.md#rollback-plan) for
what reacting in time actually involves, and the incident-response
runbook at
[apps/docs/operations/incident-response.md](../operations/incident-response.md)
for the operational playbook. This page describes what the contract
enforces; the incident-response runbook covers what people do in
response.

**`set_adapter` and one-shot `set_paused` calls are not similarly bounded.**
Unlike `migrate_adapter`, neither has a slippage cap or a timelock, because
neither moves funds on its own: `set_adapter` only succeeds against an
empty vault (see "What the admin key can do"), and `set_paused` only blocks
new deposits. A compromised key exercising either causes operational
disruption (a live vault effectively frozen to new deposits, or a repointed
empty vault) rather than fund loss.

**A compromised key that also completes `transfer_admin`/`accept_admin`
before the legitimate admin reacts is a full, permanent handover.** The
two-step design (see "What the admin key can do") protects against a
_mistyped_ successor address, not a malicious one with its own signature
ready to call `accept_admin` immediately. Detecting and reacting to a
suspicious `transfer_admin` nomination before its matching `accept_admin`
lands is the same race the migration timelock exists for, but without a
compiled-in delay to widen the window. This is the highest-severity
incident category the incident-response runbook will need to cover.
