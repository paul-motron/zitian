# Signing Flow

Zitian's core security property is that the server never holds or touches private keys. The signing flow enforces this by splitting transaction construction and transaction signing into separate steps on separate systems. Signing itself goes through the `WalletAdapter` interface, so the flow below applies to any connected wallet, not a specific one.

## Why this design

**The API receives only a public key, never a private key.** It uses the public key to fetch the account's sequence number from the Stellar RPC, which is needed to construct a valid transaction. The private key never leaves the user's device.

**The user sees the transaction before signing.** The connected wallet displays the contract address, function name, and all arguments. The user can reject if anything looks wrong.

**The API cannot forge a transaction on the user's behalf.** `caller.require_auth()` in the Soroban contract ensures the transaction is only valid if it carries a valid signature from `caller`. The API cannot produce that signature.

## What the simulation step does

Before returning XDR to the client, the API simulates the transaction against the Soroban RPC node. Simulation:

1. Executes the transaction in a read-only context to determine what contract storage entries will be read and written (the _footprint_).
2. Calculates the resource fee required to cover CPU and storage access.
3. Returns a `readBytes`, `writeBytes`, and `minResourceFee` estimate.

`rpc.assembleTransaction` then attaches this footprint and fee to the transaction. Without simulation, the transaction would fail on-chain because Soroban requires the footprint to be declared in advance.

## Network passphrase

Every Stellar transaction is bound to a specific network by its passphrase. The signed XDR from the wallet is only valid on the network it was signed for:

- Testnet: `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`
- Mainnet: `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`

The API and the wallet must agree on the passphrase. Mismatches cause signature verification to fail at submission time.

## The WalletAdapter interface

Frontend code never calls a wallet's own SDK directly. It depends on a common `WalletAdapter` interface (`apps/web/src/lib/wallet.ts`) that every supported wallet implements:

```typescript
interface WalletAdapter {
  isInstalled(): Promise<boolean>;
  isAuthorized(): Promise<boolean>; // has the user granted this site access?
  connect(): Promise<string>; // resolves the connected public key
  sign(xdr: string, networkPassphrase: string): Promise<string>; // resolves the signed XDR
}
```

The connect flow calls `isInstalled()` to detect the wallet and `connect()` to request access; a persisted session is re-validated via `isAuthorized()` on load. Signing (this doc's flow) goes through `sign()`.

A wallet picker ([#611](https://github.com/drydocs/meridian/issues/611)) is live in the header, letting a user choose between three wired-up adapters (`FreighterWallet`, `LobstrWallet`, `XBullWallet`) rather than a single hardcoded wallet. An `AlbedoWallet` adapter also exists and is tested but isn't exposed in the picker yet ([#674](https://github.com/drydocs/meridian/issues/674)). See [`architecture/frontend.md`](./frontend.md#wallet-registry-and-picker-611) for the registry/selection mechanics.

Freighter is used as the concrete example above only because it reads cleanest for a single sequence diagram; the flow itself is defined against the `WalletAdapter` interface, identical for whichever wallet the user actually picks.
