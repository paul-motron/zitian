# Zitian

**Stablecoin yield aggregator on Stellar, built for emerging market savers.**

Zitian is a savings dashboard that surfaces live USDC yields across [Blend](https://blend.capital) and [DeFindex](https://defindex.io) on the Stellar network and builds the deposit transactions your own wallet signs. Its goal is to route deposits to the highest-yielding vault automatically. It targets users in West Africa and other emerging markets where dollar-denominated savings yield meaningful real returns compared to local currency alternatives.

---

## Project status

Zitian is **not deployed**. The contracts, API, and frontend are built and tested, but this repository has no live testnet or mainnet deployment of its own yet. See [Testnet Deployment](apps/docs/operations/testnet-deployment.md) and [Mainnet Deployment](apps/docs/operations/mainnet-deployment.md) to stand one up. **No independent security audit has been completed.**

**Working today**

- USDC deposits into the `ZitianVault` coordinator contract, forwarded to its active adapter (`BlendAdapter`) and supplied straight into a Blend pool. Depositors receive mUSDC shares representing the position, with no Zitian-controlled custody of the underlying funds.
- Live APY / TVL feed across Stellar stablecoin pools (via DeFiLlama on mainnet; direct on-chain queries on testnet, since DeFiLlama doesn't index it) with a risk heuristic
- Non-custodial signing flow: the API builds an unsigned Soroban XDR, and your wallet signs and submits it, so keys never leave the browser. Freighter, LOBSTR, and xBull are wired up in the wallet picker (Albedo has an implemented, tested adapter but isn't exposed in the picker yet).
- Live TVL and per-address position reads directly from the vault (`get_total_assets`, `get_position`)
- Best-rate routing: the API recommends the highest-APY vault it can actually deposit into, skipping display-only protocols and pools flagged risky
- Protocol-agnostic adapter architecture: `ZitianVault` (ERC-4626-style share accounting hardened against the first-depositor inflation attack, pause + two-step admin-rotation rails), `BlendAdapter` (live), and a `DefindexAdapter` contract (built and tested, not yet wired to any live vault). Swapping which protocol a vault routes to is an admin-only `set_adapter` call, with no vault redeploy required. The vault's `migrate_adapter` entry point atomically moves the vault's entire position to a new adapter in one slippage-bounded transaction behind a ~1-day timelock, with no manual withdraw-then-deposit cycle. All contracts have unit test coverage.
- mUSDC is a custom SEP-41 share token, not a plain Stellar Asset Contract: transfers call back into the vault so cost basis and entry time split correctly between sender and receiver
- Per-position yield earned: cost-basis tracking via `get_principal`, surfaced in the dashboard alongside the current position value
- Admin dashboard: keeper health, live vault state, and an on-chain admin-action history feed, all reading directly from chain rather than a cached view
- Public Contract Status page: anyone can verify the deployed addresses and parameters without reading source or querying RPC directly
- English and French localisation
- Keepers triggered from GitHub Actions: an accrual keeper (refreshes cached yield from Blend) and a migration keeper (moves the vault's position to a better-yielding adapter automatically). The cron schedule in `.github/workflows/keepers.yml` is disabled until there is a deployment to call.

**In progress**

- An admin-event alert keeper exists and posts to a webhook on pause/admin-transfer/adapter-change/migration events. Without a configured webhook it runs as a clean no-op.
- Deposit/withdraw against a real DeFindex vault through `DefindexAdapter`: the adapter contract and transaction builders are implemented, gated behind `DEFINDEX_VAULT_ID` until a real vault is wired
- `ADMIN` key custody (hardware-backed or multisig) before any mainnet deployment
- Third-party security audit

Until a DeFindex vault is configured, the DeFindex deposit path throws a configuration error rather than silently routing elsewhere. Track progress in the [Roadmap](#roadmap) and [open issues](../../issues).

## Why Zitian?

Inflation in many West African economies regularly exceeds 20 % annually. Access to USD savings accounts is limited by KYC friction and minimum balances. Stellar's low fees (< $0.01/tx), fast finality (5s), and USDC availability make it an ideal rails layer. Zitian removes the final UX barrier: users connect a wallet, see live APY across protocols, and deposit in three clicks.

### Data flow

```text
User browser
  └─► Vite + React frontend
        └─► Vercel Serverless Functions (builds unsigned XDR)
              └─► ZitianVault coordinator contract
                    └─► active adapter (BlendAdapter today) ─► underlying protocol pool
                              │
                         Stellar RPC (Soroban)
```

In production, API routes are Vercel serverless functions (`api/v1/...`). The Fastify server in `apps/api-local` is used for local development only.

The API never holds private keys. It builds an unsigned Soroban transaction, returns the XDR, and the frontend forwards it to the user's connected wallet (Freighter, LOBSTR, or xBull) for signing and submission. See [`docs/signing-flow.md`](docs/signing-flow.md) for the full sequence diagram and endpoint reference.

## Protocols

### Blend Capital

Blend is a permission-less lending protocol on Stellar. Zitian reads pool APY from Blend's on-chain pool data entries and builds deposit/withdraw transactions via Soroban contract invocations. See [`packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/blend.ts`](packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/blend.ts).

### DeFindex

DeFindex is a yield-strategy vault protocol on Stellar that composes multiple yield sources behind a single share token. Zitian treats each DeFindex vault as a single aggregated position. See [`packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/defindex.ts`](packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/defindex.ts).

## Roadmap

### Shipped: deposit, withdraw, and earn, on mainnet

Non-custodial USDC deposits into the `ZitianVault` coordinator contract, working end-to-end for Blend via `BlendAdapter`. Wallet connects in one click (Freighter, LOBSTR, or xBull), the best-rate vault is selected automatically, and the signed transaction never leaves the browser. Live APY and TVL across protocols with risk-tier labelling. Withdraw at any time, no lock-up. DeFindex support is built (`DefindexAdapter`) but not yet wired to a live vault on either network.

### Shipped: yield history and position analytics (partial)

Per-position yield tracking with a cost-basis model is shipped: users already see cumulative earned alongside their current balance. Remaining: a yield history chart broken down by protocol, entry time, and cumulative earned over time. Position-level analytics that work whether funds are in Blend, DeFindex, or split across both.

### Shipped: automatic yield routing (built and tested, not yet deployed)

A scheduled keeper that compares live rates across a vault's candidate adapters and calls the vault's `migrate_adapter` when a candidate clears a configured improvement threshold is built and tested end to end (see [#469](../../issues/469)): rate comparison for both Blend and DeFindex, discovery, retry, deadline-budget handling, and slippage/threshold-bounded submission all work. What's left is operational: a deployed vault whose admin grants the migration-keeper key authority, after deciding `ADMIN`'s custody model.

### Next: deployment and hardening

A testnet deployment, then a third-party security audit, `ADMIN` key custody (hardware-backed or multisig), and the admin-event alert keeper's webhook before any mainnet deployment. See [`apps/docs/operations/mainnet-deployment.md`](apps/docs/operations/mainnet-deployment.md). A production-grade rate-limit and caching layer for real user load, and a mobile-first UI pass targeting low-end Android devices common in the target market, are also still ahead.
