# Security Policy

Zitian is a DeFi application that routes real user funds through Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network. We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow this policy rather than opening a public issue.

## Supported Versions

| Version          | Supported         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `main` branch    | Yes               |
| `develop` branch | Yes (pre-release) |
| All others       | No                |

## Scope

### In Scope

The following are considered in scope for vulnerability reports:

- **Soroban smart contracts** (`packages/contracts/`) on Stellar **mainnet** — treat any finding here as **Critical severity**
- **Soroban smart contracts** on Stellar **testnet** — treat as High severity
- **API server** (`apps/api-local/`) — authentication bypass, injection, SSRF, exposed secrets, improper input validation
- **Frontend** (`apps/web/`) — XSS, insecure wallet interaction, transaction manipulation before signing
- **SDK helpers** (`packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/`) — incorrect transaction construction, signing logic flaws, improper RPC handling
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** that directly affect on-chain behaviour or user funds
- **Private key or seed phrase exposure** anywhere in the codebase or build artifacts

### Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party protocols (Blend Capital, DeFindex) — report those to their respective teams
- Issues that require physical access to a user's device
- Social engineering attacks against users or maintainers
- Findings on testnet that have no realistic path to mainnet exploitation
- Rate limiting or DDoS on the public API (covered by existing mitigations)
- Self-XSS or issues requiring the attacker to already control the victim's browser session
- Theoretical vulnerabilities with no demonstrated impact

## How to Report

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting**:

1. Go to [https://github.com/paul-motron/zitian/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/paul-motron/zitian/security/advisories/new)
2. Fill in the advisory form with as much detail as possible (see below)
3. Submit — this creates a private draft advisory visible only to you and the maintainer

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Description** — what is the vulnerability and where does it exist
- **Impact** — what can an attacker achieve (e.g. drain funds, steal keys, forge transactions)
- **Reproduction steps** — the minimum steps needed to reproduce the issue
- **Affected component** — contract address / file path / endpoint
- **Network** — testnet or mainnet
- **Suggested fix** — optional, but appreciated

## Response SLA

| Stage                                  | Target                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledgement                        | Best effort within **48 hours** — see note¹   |
| Initial triage and severity assessment | Within **5 business days**                    |
| Fix or mitigation for Critical/High    | Within **14 days** where technically feasible |
| Public disclosure                      | Coordinated with reporter after fix deploys   |

¹ Zitian is solo-maintained, so response times are best effort.

We will keep you informed at each stage. If you do not receive an acknowledgement within 48 hours, add a comment to the advisory.

## Severity Guidance

| Severity     | Examples                                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Drain funds via mainnet contract exploit; private key exposure |
| **High**     | Unauthorised tx signing; testnet exploit with mainnet path     |
| **Medium**   | API auth bypass without fund access; XSS in wallet flow        |
| **Low**      | Information disclosure; input gap with no fund risk            |

**On-chain contracts deployed to mainnet are always treated as Critical severity regardless of the apparent difficulty of exploitation.** Even a theoretical vulnerability in a contract holding user funds warrants immediate response.

---

## Disclosure Policy

Zitian follows **coordinated disclosure**:

- We ask reporters to allow us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- We will not take legal action against researchers acting in good faith under this policy
- We will credit reporters in the security advisory and release notes unless they request anonymity
- We do not currently offer a monetary bug bounty, but we will advocate for Wave program recognition for significant findings

## Known Limitations (Current Development Phase)

Zitian `v0.1.0` is a pre-mainnet scaffold. No real user funds are at risk in the current release. However, smart contract code merged into `main` that is intended for mainnet deployment must be reviewed as if funds are already at stake.
